A version of the 2048 game for the Programming in C++ assignment.

Use your arrow keys to move the tiles. When two tiles with the same number touch, they merge into one.You win by combining tiles up until 2048, but if you fill the board with no moves available then you lose!

Enter start value as an arguement. You can alter the spawn value of tiles for greater ease of play.
Change the skin colour of the game between three styles.
Pull up instructions in the game.
You can use the "AI" to randomly move, it will start new games once a game has lost and will continue to make moves until told otherwise.
